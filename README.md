reddit-image-and-pastebin-parser
======================

Two scripts with functionality that talks with reddit, imgur, pastebin and placekitten.
A fun project of mine I still need to expand on, with a rewrite of the pastebin side of things.

image-parser
======================
A reddit parser which parses reddit's JSON finding imgur links and storing them in a file.
Functionality for the website 'placekitten.com' was also added.

pastebin-parser
======================
Reads through reddit's JSON and gets the pastebins.
Description will be expanded once I commit the re-write
