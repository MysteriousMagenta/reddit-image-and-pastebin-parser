reddit-pastebin-parser
======================

A simple parser that reads through /r/learnpython and takes the pastebins.
I was bored one day and saw all the cool reddit bots and thought "I should make my own." so I did.
And here's the result.
It reads the pastebins from http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/new/ and stuffs them in a file.
